              Assassin's Creed is a 2016 historical science fiction action film
              based on the video game franchise of the same name. The film is
              directed by Justin Kurzel, written by Michael Lesslie, Adam Cooper
              and Bill Collage, and stars Michael Fassbender (who also
              produced), as well as Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, Brendan
              Gleeson, Charlotte Rampling and Michael K. Williams. The film is
              set in the same universe as the video games but features an
              original story that expands the series' mythology. The plot
              revolves around Callum "Cal" Lynch (Fassbender), who is abducted
              by the Abstergo Foundation because of his heritage.

              Oblivion is a 2013 American post-apocalyptic action-adventure film
              produced and directed by Joseph Kosinski from a screenplay by Karl
              Gajdusek and Michael deBruyn, starring Tom Cruise in the main role
              alongside Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea Riseborough,
              Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, and Melissa Leo in supporting roles. Based
              on Kosinski's unpublished graphic novel of the same name, the film
              pays homage to 1970s sci-fi, and is a "love story" set in 2077 on
              an Earth desolated by an alien war; a maintenance technician on
              the verge of completing his mission finds a woman who survived
              from a space ship crash, leading him to question his purpose and
              discover the truth about the war.
